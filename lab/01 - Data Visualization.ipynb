    "The challenge we're trying to address here is to detect anomalies in the components of a Wind Turbine. Each wind turbine has many sensors that reads data like:\n",
    " - Internal & external temperature\n",
    " - Wind speed\n",
    " - Rotor speed\n",
    " - Air pressure\n",
    " - Voltage (or current) in the generator\n",
    " - Vibration in the GearBox (using an IMU -> Accelerometer + Gyroscope)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, depending on the types of the anomalies we want to detect, we need to select one or more features and then prepare a dataset that 'explains' the anomalies. We are interested in three types of anomalies:\n",
    " - Rotor speed (when the rotor is not in an expected speed)\n",
    " - Produced voltage (when the generator is not producing the expected voltage)\n",
    " - Gearbox vibration (when the vibration of the gearbox is far from the expected)\n",
    " \n",
    "All these three anomalies (or violations) depend on many variables while the turbine is working. Thus, in order to address that, let's use a ML model called [Autoencoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder), with correlated features. This model is unsupervised. It learns the latent representation of the dataset and tries to predict (regression) the same tensor given as input. The strategy then is to use a dataset collected from a normal turbine (without anomalies). The model will then learn **'what is a normal turbine'**. When the sensors readings of a malfunctioning turbine is used as input, the model will not be able to rebuild the input, predicting something with a high error and detected as an anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of the sensors readings can be seen as a time-series dataset and therefore we observe a high correlation between neighbour samples. We can explore this by reformatting the data as a multidimensional tensor. We'll create a temporal encoding of six features in 10x10 steps of 250ms each. 250ms is the interval computed using 5 samples (the time interval between each sample is ~50ms). It means that we will create a tensor with a shape of 6x10x10.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tensor](imgs/tensor.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the tensor above, each color is a different feature, encoded in 100 (10x10) timesteps (from the current reading to the past in a sliding window).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start preparing our dataset, then."
